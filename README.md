## Data viz doodle ðŸŽ¨ - my 2024 in books

- This is a data viz dashboard I made for fun, using my data from The StoryGraph, data I annotated myself, as well as data I scraped from The StoryGraph.
  
- Since I typically read/listen to 50+ books a year, these stats are always on my mind. Both Goodreads and The StoryGraph already provide year in review stats,
  but I also wanted to visualize more detailed trends. So I generated plots for the things I wanted to see.  

- Preprocessing and EDA are done via Colab + Plotly + Pandas + Python. Figures are exported as HTML files and embedded in the dashboard.
