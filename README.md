## Data viz doodle ðŸŽ¨

- This is a data viz dashboard I made for fun, using my data from The StoryGraph, data I annotated myself, as well as data I scraped from The StoryGraph.

- Both Goodreads and The StoryGraph already provide year in review stats, but they do not provide fine-grained stats for some of the stuff I'm looking for.  

- Preprocessing and EDA are done via Colab + Plotly + Pandas + Python. Figures are exported as HTML files and embedded in the dashboard.
