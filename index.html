                Lighter color = fewer books in progress. It's clear that I'm rarely reading 1 thing at a time.<br />

                How many days does it take me to finish a book? This plot visualizes the time taken to read each
                book. <br />
                Each book is represented by a vertical bar. Longer bar = More days. <br />
                I tend to finish most books within 30 days (this is also the typical loan period for a book). <br />

                How do my ratings compare to community ratings? How popular are the books I read? <br />
                Circle sizes correspond to popularity. More community reviews+ratings = larger circle. <br />
                X-coordinate is my rating (in 0.25 increments), Y-coordinate is the community's average
                rating.<br />
                Only a few of the things I read are super popular. I also tend to rate popular books lower than
                their community ratings.

                What's the disparity between my rating and the community rating? <br />
                The rating difference is within 0.5 stars for all books. This is not that surprising
                since:<br />
                1. I tend to be quite moderate with ratings. 2. I only pick up stuff with a 3.5+ community
                rating. <br />

                Only books are included here, no audiobooks. Colours corresponds to the genre tags. <br />
                The thickest books are typically YA. Memoirs and graphic novels are usually shorter.

                Audiobooks are increasingly a staple for me. This plot visualizes the length of audiobooks in hours.

                Each book is represented by a stack of circles. A full circle = 1 hour. <br />
                Memoir is a big genre for me, whether book or audiobook. Fiction is a genre I primarily listen to.
